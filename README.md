# CODSOFT-3
# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their
symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends when one player achieves this goal or when the board is full, resulting in a draw.

## Features
- Supports two players taking turns to play.
- Checks for win conditions after each move to determine the winner.
- Handles invalid moves gracefully, prompting players to retry.

## How to Play
1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable file.
3. Players take turns entering the row and column of the cell they want to mark with their symbol ('X' or 'O').
4. The game checks for win conditions after each move.
5. The game ends when one player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
